; example of remote REPL
; you can use any transport, tcp:// ipc:// websocket inproc
; see http://nanomsg.org/v1.0.0/nanomsg.7.html
; and nanomsg.sls for details
;
; ./local-repl tcp://127.0.0.1:12345
; ABC
;
; meanwhile in another terminal...
; ./remote-repl tcp://127.0.0.1:12345
; > (+ 1 2)
; 3
; > (printf "ABC~n") --> will print ABC on the local repl process
;
; The nice thing is that you can scale to any protocol and
; that it can be integrated in an event/main loop
; it uses non-blocking (read) and you invoke (my-local-repl) until => #f
;
; TODO: add a command for local exit. #!eof object will only close the remote 
; connection....
